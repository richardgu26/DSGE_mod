# DSGE_mod 

A collection of Dynare models. It aims at demonstrating Dynare best practices 
and providing tractable replication files for important models that can be 
useful for further model development. 

## Replicability Issues

The headers of the respective mod-files also note obvious mistakes and typos 
in the respective papers.  

## Compatibility

These mod-files have been tested against the current unstable version, to be released
as Dynare 4.5. Compatibility with earlier versions is not guaranteed.

# Contributing your own mod-files

Contributions of replication files to this collection are highly welcomed. 
When doing do, e.g. through pull requests, please clearly line out which 
results of the original paper are replicated so that correctness can be 
verified.

This mod-file shows how to access steady state variables in order to plot steady state dependences on parameters. 
It also shows how to manually do a stability mapping be iterating over a grid on the parameter space.
 
## Aguiar_Gopinath_2007.mod

The model setup is described in Handout_RBC_model.pdf and resembles the one in King/Rebelo (1999): Resuscitating Real Business Cycles, Handbook of Macroeconomics, Volume 1, and

calibrated to US data. It shows how to generate IRFs to a "pure" news shock 
where an 8 period anticipated news shock does not materialize at time 0. This

## Solow_model

Various mod-files related to the basic Solow-Swan model, using Dynare's perfect
foresight routines to study steady state transitions when e.g. parameters change

### Solow_SS_transition.mod 
Studies the transition behavior of a simple Solow-Swan economy with Cobb-Douglas 
production function to its steady state when started with a capital stock different
from steady state.

### Solow_growth_rate_changes.mod 
Studies the transition behavior of a simple Solow-Swan economy with Cobb-Douglas production 
function after unanticipated for changes in technology or population growth. 

### Solow_nonstationary.mod 
Studies the transition behavior of a simple Solow-Swan economy with Cobb-Douglas production 
function to its balanced growth path (BGP). The Solow model is solved here in aggregate, 
i.e. non-detrended form along its balanced growth path. For that purpose, trending labor-augmenting
technology and population processes are defined.
